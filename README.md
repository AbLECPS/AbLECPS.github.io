# AbLECPS - Assurance based Learning Enabled Cyber Physical Systems

This is the GitHub page for AbLECPS - **ALC Toolchain** public release (03-16-23)

BlueROV2 Standalone example in the Toolchain is a complete software system for fault tolerant autonomous underwater vehicles, based on ROS and the UUV Simulator, extended excessively by the Institute of Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University,.

If you want to use the IDE of the toolchain, here is a step-by-step example for running BlueROV complex example with RQT for behaviour trees, RViz.
Prerequisites: Toolchain set up as described in the documentation (Chapter 5.2. Initial Setup in IDE)
